    "text": "Understanding Evaluation Mapping in the UN Context\nUN evaluation work encompasses several interconnected domains:\n\nQuality Check: Assessing evidence quality and methodological rigor in evaluation reports\nMapping/Tagging: Identifying which standardized framework themes are central to each report\nImpact Evaluation: Measuring program effectiveness using RCTs, quasi-experimental designs, etc.\nSynthesis: Aggregating findings across reports on specific themes/regions to generate insights\n\nMapping/tagging is a foundational step that identifies which themes from established evaluation frameworks (like IOM’s Strategic Results Framework or the UN Global Compact for Migration) are central to each report. These frameworks provide agreed-upon nomenclature covering all relevant themes, ensuring common terminology across stakeholders and enabling interoperability for UN-wide aggregation and communication.\nRather than extracting evidence for specific themes, mapping creates a curated index enabling evaluators to retrieve the most relevant reports for subsequent synthesis work, maximizing both precision (finding all relevant reports) and recall (avoiding irrelevant ones).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThroughout this documentation, we use “mapping” and “tagging” interchangeably.",

    "text": "What is Evaluatr?\nEvaluatr is an AI-powered system that automates mapping evaluation reports against structured frameworks while maintaining interpretability and human oversight. Initially developed for IOM (International Organization for Migration) evaluation reports and the Strategic Results Framework (SRF), it transforms a traditionally manual, time-intensive process into an efficient, transparent workflow.\nThe system maps evaluation reports against hierarchical frameworks like the SRF (objectives, enablers, cross-cutting priorities, outcomes, outputs, indicators) and connects to broader frameworks like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for interoperability.\nBeyond automation, Evaluatr prioritizes interpretability and human-AI collaboration—enabling evaluators to understand the mapping process, audit AI decisions, perform error analysis, and build training datasets over time, ensuring the system aligns with organizational needs through actionable, transparent, auditable methodology.",

Document Preparation Pipeline ✅ Available\n\nRepository Processing: Read and preprocess IOM evaluation report repositories with standardized outputs\nAutomated Downloads: Batch download of evaluation documents from diverse sources\nOCR Processing: Convert scanned PDFs to searchable text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology\nContent Enrichment: Fix OCR-corrupted headings and enrich documents with AI-generated image descriptions for high-quality input data\n\n\n\n2. AI-Assisted Framework Mapping ✅ Available\n\nMulti-Stage Pipeline: Three-stage mapping process that progressively narrows from broad themes ( SRF Enablers, Cross-cutting Priorities, GCM objectives) to specific SRF outputs. Each stage enriches context for the next—for example, knowing a report is cross-cutting in nature helps accurately map specific SRF outputs\nCost Optimization: Leverages LLM prompt caching to minimize token usage and API costs during repeated analysis\nCommand-line Interface: Streamlined pipeline execution through easy-to-use CLI tools (evl_ocr, evl_md_plus, evl_tag)\nTransparent Tracing: Complete audit trails of AI decisions stored for human review and evaluation\n\n\n\n3. Knowledge Synthesis 📋 Planned\n\nKnowledge Cards: Generate structured summaries for downstream AI tasks like proposal writing and synthesis",

Select sections where report authors signal what matters most - these will be used to tag themes for future synthesis work.\n\n### SECTIONS TO IDENTIFY\nLook for sections that reveal core themes (in any language):\n1. Executive Summary / Overview / Résumé exécutif / Resumen ejecutivo\n2. Introduction / Objectives / Purpose / Questions d'évaluation / Preguntas de evaluación\n3. Main Findings / Results / Résultats / Resultados / Constatations\n4. Conclusions / Conclusiones\n5. Recommendations / Recommandations / Recomendaciones\n\n### SELECTION CRITERIA\n- Match flexibly by meaning, not exact wording\n- Prioritize where authors explicitly state what's important\n- Aim for ~8-10 pages total (use page numbers in ToC as guide)\n- Avoid methodology, background, annexes unless unusually central\n- Not all report types have all sections - select what exists\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT\nJSON with section_names (list) and reasoning (string).\n\n**CRITICAL**: section_names must contain EXACT strings from the ToC provided.\nCopy the complete line including section numbers and page references.\nExample: If ToC shows \"4.1.
