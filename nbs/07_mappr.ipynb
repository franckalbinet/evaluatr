    "We could have leveraged DSPy's built-in [`ReAct` module](https://dspy.ai/api/modules/ReAct), which provides an agent-based approach where the LLM automatically decides when and how to use exploration tools. The \"ReAct\" concept has been introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629). However, we chose to implement our own iterative analyzer from scratch for several critical reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open-ended vs. Structured Nature**: DSPy's ReAct is designed for open-ended problem solving where the agent explores freely using available tools. Our use case requires a more structured, methodical approach to document analysis with predictable exploration patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document-Specific Control**: Our approach is tailored specifically for structured document exploration with hierarchical headings, allowing us to implement domain-specific logic for section navigation and content retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluator Requirements**: Since traces will be reviewed by human evaluators for error analysis, we needed explicit, step-by-step decision logging rather than the more implicit reasoning chains that ReAct provides."

Government officials and other stakeholders have reported an increase in their capacity, and sometimes even resources, to work on return and reintegration, resulting in the introduction of new policies and processes and improved cooperation mechanisms.
