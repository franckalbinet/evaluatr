    "**Why We Built a Custom Iterative Analyzer Instead of Using DSPy ReAct?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have leveraged DSPy's built-in [`ReAct` module](https://dspy.ai/api/modules/ReAct), which provides an agent-based approach where the LLM automatically decides when and how to use exploration tools. The \"ReAct\" concept has been introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629). However, we chose to implement our own iterative analyzer from scratch for several critical reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open-ended vs. Structured Nature**: DSPy's ReAct is designed for open-ended problem solving where the agent explores freely using available tools. Our use case requires a more structured, methodical approach to document analysis with predictable exploration patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document-Specific Control**: Our approach is tailored specifically for structured document exploration with hierarchical headings, allowing us to implement domain-specific logic for section navigation and content retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluator Requirements**: Since traces will be reviewed by human evaluators for error analysis, we needed explicit, step-by-step decision logging rather than the more implicit reasoning chains that ReAct provides."
