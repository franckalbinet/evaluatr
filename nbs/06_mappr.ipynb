    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Manually mapping evaluation reports against IOM's Strategic Results Framework (SRF) is time-consuming and resource-intensive with ~150 outputs to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Multi-stage pipeline leveraging Global Compact for Migration (GCM) as a pruning mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 1: Sequential Classification\n",
    "1. **Enablers & Cross-cutting Priorities** (11 items) - Fast parallel analysis to identify meta-evaluation nature\n",
    "2. **GCM Objectives** (23 items) - Informed by Stage 1 results, uses condensed representations for efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 2: Targeted SRF Analysis  \n",
    "- Use GCM results + `gcm_srf_lut` to prune ~150 SRF outputs to ~20-50 relevant ones\n",
    "- Deep analysis with full hierarchy context (objective → outcome → output → indicators)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- **Agentic workflow**: LLM navigates document headings, explores sections iteratively until confident\n",
    "- **DSPy signatures**: Structured reasoning with built-in tracing for evaluation\n",
    "- **Rate-limited parallelization**: Respects API constraints (15 RPM) using fastcore\n",
    "- **False positive bias**: Better to over-include than miss relevant mappings"
