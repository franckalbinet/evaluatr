The \"ReAct\" concept has been introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629). However, we chose to implement our own iterative analyzer from scratch for several critical reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open-ended vs. Structured Nature**: DSPy's ReAct is designed for open-ended problem solving where the agent explores freely using available tools. Our use case requires a more structured, methodical approach to document analysis with predictable exploration patterns.\n",

    "- **Document-Specific Control**: Our approach is tailored specifically for structured document exploration with hierarchical headings, allowing us to implement domain-specific logic for section navigation and content retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluator Requirements**: Since traces will be reviewed by human evaluators for error analysis, we needed explicit, step-by-step decision logging rather than the more implicit reasoning chains that ReAct provides."

      "Desk research and interviews confirm that the programme responded to the most pressing needs of migrants. The JI-HoA enabled them to return from dangerous environments, such as detention, where no other support was available. Migrants shared that they suffered on their irregular migration journeys, had acutely distressing experiences ${ }^{13}$, and highlighted that their families and communities could not help them ${ }^{14}$. Stakeholders supporting migrants in Djibouti stressed in this regard that the most urgent problems were prioritised, such as hunger, thirst, and fatigue. The JI-HoA, first of all, tried to save their lives by providing the necessary means to survive, such as food, water, clothing and shelter ${ }^{15}$.\n",

      "However, the survey among migrants in MRC indicated that, while $68 \\%$ of respondents were satisfied with the MRC services, only $39 \\%$ reported that the MRCs met all or almost all their needs. IOM explained this number by noting that a large majority of respondents were surveyed while still waiting for their Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration (AVRR), which suggests that the support was not provided immediately. Therefore, quicker service provision and AVRR were among the most listed elements for improvement by the respondents. ${ }^{16}$\n",

Namely, upon arrival, returnees are faced with a lack of economic resources to sustain themselves, face stigma and exclusion from community members and experience effects of their distressing migration experiences that affect their ability to rebuild their lives. Therefore, the integrated approach to economic, social, and psychosocial support was of a great relevance to the challenges faced by returnees.\n",

      "Focus Group Discussions highlighted the importance of the economic assistance to enable returnees to develop sources of income (e.g. through start-up businesses or employment). Since returnees are coming back usually \"empty-handed\", they are experiencing shame, guilt, and are stigmatised by their communities and relatives. The economic support offered by the JI-HoA not only provides them with resources to start their business but also restores their dignity and self-trust ${ }^{18}$.\n",

      "In the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), some returnees pointed out that the overall value of the economic assistance was not enough. ${ }^{19}$ This was also confirmed by a stakeholder from Sudan, who suggested that returnees needed more money to satisfy their livelihood during the time of planting, growing and harvesting, since they put most of the microbusiness support into the producing and often have no other sources of income ${ }^{20}$. The microbusiness assistance did not always correspond to the knowledge of the recipient or the local context. Namely, a few of the returnees revealed that they were not consulted or received different support than they selected, so they had no other option, but just to accept the support ${ }^{21}$.\n",

      "In terms of psychosocial needs, research results presented at the Research and Evidence Facility (REF) conference of June 2022 indicated that the incidence of Common Mental Disorders (CMD) is significantly higher among JI-HoA beneficiaries in Ethiopia when compared with non-migrant control group ${ }^{22}$. The high prevalence of CMD among returned migrants from the Middle East was also found in another study ${ }^{23}$. This indicates that irregular migrants are much more affected by the CMD compared to people who do not migrate.

      "The interviews and the desk research analysis revealed that the programme addressed many priorities of communities in terms of reintegration and livelihoods support. One of the main drivers of migration is the lack of economic opportunities to secure a livelihood, combined with the prevailing perception that jobs are available elsewhere. The creation of economic opportunities within the community reduces the risk of social conflict (e.g. negative attitudes to returnees who receive financial support as described above), while simultaneously decreasing the drive to migrate out of economic necessity among other community members.\n",

The overall trend indicates a high level of perceived relevance and effectiveness of the projects, suggesting that the JI-HoA projects are generally viewed as beneficial by the communities surveyed and also for returnees.

The main goal of this framework was to provide advice and further strategies to support comprehensive migration management, to harmonise policies between countries, and to recommend and support formulating good policies in migration.

      "\n",
      "The EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration in the Horn of Africa was a unique effort to support return and reintegration in a highly complex political and economic context. The scope of the support provided (e.g. considering all dimensions of the integrated approach) required extensive investment of resources by IOM and stakeholders, but created valuable, even life-saving benefits for beneficiaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the challenges, the JI-HoA has created important results and impact on the individual level. Desk research, interviews, and Focus Group Discussions point out that the EU-IOM Joint Initiative has been of crucial importance to address the needs of migrants and returnees facing dire situations (including abuse, violence, and exploitation) in their host countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continuous contact between IOM and returnees ensured that returnees' needs were identified and monitored from the moment of their identification in the host/transit country. Extensive evidence was found of efforts made by MRCs and IOM staff to identify vulnerabilities and provide individualized support in terms of economic support, social support, and psychosocial support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, community-based reintegration projects were helpful in creating business and employment opportunities (although their impact was still affected by the overall economic decline) and various community members noted this support as important factor reducing their need to migrate for economic reasons. Additionally, CBR projects have also shown clear value for social cohesion and reduction of stigmas towards returnees, which in turn supported their reintegration. Various examples were found regarding the link between social cohesion and economic self-sufficiency of returnees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the JI-HoA has made important contributions to the availability of data and research on migration trends in the region. The impact in this regard is twofold. Firstly, stakeholders explicitly appreciated the work of the Regional Data Hub in terms of data production and capacity building. The dissemination and subsequent use of data in decision-making can have a long-term positive impact on return and reintegration, by providing governments and stakeholders with tools and capacity to use these data in there policy- and decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the research done by the JI-HoA itself as part of its monitoring and evaluation has provided important evidence for programming. It allowed the IOM and its partners and stakeholders to learn about the diverse needs of returnees, which needs can be addressed, and what approaches are more or less effective. This knowledge is of great importance to inform migrant protection, return and reintegration programming in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "The complexity of the JI-HoA and the integrated approach, and the fragility of existing systems in the Horn of Africa countries, leads to the conclusion that ownership and sustainability of the programme cannot be expected after five years of implementation. Important progress has been made, but continued support is needed in terms of capacity-building, but also for wider socio-economic development and security in the four countries in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "Namely, the vast majority of challenges and barriers to the achievements of the JI-HoA are linked to the context in which it takes place, and to external factors. Capacity-building efforts were undermined by political priorities and staff turnover; referral systems and service provision for migrants and returnees were hindered by a lack of a structure national referral mechanism, well-functioning health and social security systems, and economic support lost value in the face of a deteriorating economic situation and inflation. Activities of the JI were furthermore hindered by civil conflict and security issues. Therefore, the situation of returnees cannot be addressed without simultaneously addressing the wider socio-economic context.\n",

      "### 5.2. Recommendations .... page 28\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the conclusions of the evaluation, the evaluation team has designed the following recommendations towards migrant protection, return and reintegration programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Enhance efforts with national, regional, and local stakeholders to build capacity and ownership (while continuing provision of funding).\n",
      "\n",
      "The EU-IOM Joint Initiative has put visible effort in building the capacity of national actors to support return and reintegration. However, political priorities did not always ensure ownership and commitment of governments to take the JI results forward. Additionally, turnover of staff has removed trained staff and therefore undone some of the work of the JI in this regard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two important steps need to be taken to enhance the capacity and ownership of key stakeholders, which would set the scene for sustainability and impact. Firstly, capacity building should be expanded to a wider scope of persons. This should include the entire relevant organisational departments, ensuring the participation of top and middle management as well as their staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, capacity alone is not sufficient to ensure impact and sustainability of the work on return and reintegration. Therefore, migrant protection, return and reintegration programming should focus also on enhancing ownership and commitment of stakeholders towards these topics. Possible steps include the gradual integration of MRCs with the relevant public sector organizations, or coownership/management of the MRCs by local governments (along with IOM) where some of the employees are funded by the local government. In addition, the migrant protection, return and reintegration programming should continue to support the integration of return and reintegration into policy documents and development plans\n",
      "\n",
      "However, sustainability and independent work by governments and stakeholders is not something that should be expected in the near future. Therefore, financial resources from donors will still need to be allocated to governments and stakeholders to implement their policies and services for returnees.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Strengthen community-based reintegration efforts to address drivers of irregular migration and provide economic opportunities that reduce the necessity to migrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current evaluation has demonstrated the great importance of CBR projects as a component of the integrated approach. However, gaps were found in the design, M\\&E, and relevance of some of the projects. Therefore, migrant protection, return and reintegration programming should be focused on enhancing the quality of the CBR projects in relation to the needs of the community members. Possibly, this may require larger-scale projects by a smaller sample of Implementing Partners, to ensure IOM can keep a better oversight of the project design, needs analysis and implementation.\n",

      "\n",
      "The use of service providers not funded under the JI has multiple benefits to strengthen the work done under the JI. Namely, it can contribute to the capacity of service providers to support returnees; it contributes to the development and strengthening of referral systems; it contributes to policies on social security, insurance, and budgeting for service provisions; and finally, it reduces the costs of IOM. Therefore, capacity building of such existing service providers, who can function without significant financial support, can be a crucial element contributing to long-term impact and sustainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "To continue strengthening partnerships, the IOM should also explore complementarity with other organisations which are focused on strengthening service provision. Namely, there is a need not only to strengthen partnerships and referrals but also to strengthen the quality of service provision in general (e.g. considering the lack of psychiatrists in Djibouti and lack of attention to mental health in most countries). Current efforts to build referral systems are not sustainable unless the service providers are able to function effectively themselves.\n",
      "4. Explore opportunities for the continued (co-)funding of key, effective, and relevant activities in line with those supported under the JI-HOA. These activities include direct and specialized assistance in transit, including AVR assistance for migrants along all key migration routes from the HOA (including the Eastern, Southern, and Northern Route), an integrated approach to reintegration (individual reintegration support, CBR projects, structural level interventions) as well as support to the Regional Data Hub.\n",
      "\n",
      "The work of IOM in countries of transit and destination has been noted as most relevant and important, as it directly involves the saving of lives. Therefore, the continuation of AVR support to migrants is directly linked to rescue and protection. A termination of this component, even if partial to specific migration routes, has detrimental consequences for migrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evaluation found that the community-level approach to reintegration has been crucial for the achievements of the JI-HoA, both as standalone activities to enhance livelihoods, but also as integral component of the Integrated Approach. The effectiveness of the CBR projects to support reintegration and address drivers of irregular migration has been underlined and substantiated in this evaluation. Additionally, the evaluation found that the integrated approach itself is of great importance to link all\n",

      "The work of the Regional Data Hub was highly appreciated by stakeholders and the activities of the hub were effective in enhancing knowledge on migration, harmonizing methodologies and indicators, and building capacities for data collection and management. There is a clear interest of stakeholders to continue working with the RDH on improving research and data in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is strongly recommended that IOM explores funding sources to ensure the continuation of the aforementioned activities. IOM should explore, for example, opportunities for funding and cooperation under the inter-agency framework established under the Migrant Response Plan for the Horn of Africa and Yemen.\n",

      "#### 5.2.2. Explore opportunities to extend the scope of support provided to returnees, with a focus on longer-term integration. .... page 30\n",
      "\n",
      "While the emergency support on arrival (cash, medical services, MHPSS) was deemed highly relevant, important, and effective, the evaluation has shown that returnees still struggle with sustainable reintegration. This relates in particular to their ability to sustain themselves and their families economically.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this regard, additional gains could be made by enrolling returnees back into formal education (for those who did not complete it), possibly with some allowance, and by focusing more attention to the development of entrepreneurial skills as foundation for starting sustainable (micro-)businesses. This requires additional research into the factors influencing the success of the businesses initiated by returnees under the JI.\n",
      "6. Continue supporting and strengthening safe, humane, and orderly migration pathways, by providing direct support to migrants in distress, and engaging and building the capacities of key stakeholders involved in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most visible and important achievement of the JI-HoA has been the immediate, life-saving support provided to migrants who suffered various forms of abuse and trauma, and who did not have any other chance of returning. Currently, this evaluation believes that governments and stakeholders do not have the capacity to continue this work independently, although irregular migration continues to take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human trafficking and abuse take place in all migration directions out of the Horn of Africa (North, East, and South) and therefore requires a continued investment in AVR in Djibouti and other transit countries from where migrants return to the HoA. Any gaps in provision of AVR has direct consequences for stranded migrants.\n",
      "7. Build on the results of the IMPACT evaluation conducted under the JI-HoA by continuing to test and adjust the tools to measure reintegration sustainability and by conducting additional impact evaluations on key elements of AVRR.\n",
