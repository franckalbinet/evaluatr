    "## Understanding Evaluation Mapping in the UN Context\n",
    "\n",
    "UN evaluation work encompasses several interconnected domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quality Check**: Assessing evidence quality and methodological rigor in evaluation reports\n",
    "- **Mapping/Tagging**: Identifying which standardized framework themes are central to each report\n",
    "- **Impact Evaluation**: Measuring program effectiveness using RCTs, quasi-experimental designs, etc.\n",
    "- **Synthesis**: Aggregating findings across reports on specific themes/regions to generate insights\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mapping/tagging** is a foundational step that identifies which themes from established evaluation frameworks (like IOM's Strategic Results Framework or the UN Global Compact for Migration) are *central* to each report. These frameworks provide agreed-upon nomenclature covering all relevant themes, ensuring common terminology across stakeholders and enabling interoperability for UN-wide aggregation and communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than extracting evidence for specific themes, mapping creates a curated index enabling evaluators to retrieve the most relevant reports for subsequent synthesis work, maximizing both precision (finding all relevant reports) and recall (avoiding irrelevant ones).\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "Throughout this documentation, we use \"mapping\" and \"tagging\" interchangeably.\n",

    "## The Challenge We Solve\n",
    "\n",
    "IOM evaluators possess deep expertise in mapping evaluation reports against frameworks like the Strategic Results Framework (SRF), but face significant operational challenges when processing reports that often exceed 150 pages of diverse content across multiple projects and contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core challenges are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time-intensive process**: Hundreds of staff-hours required per comprehensive mapping exercise\n",
    "- **Individual consistency**: Even expert evaluators may categorize the same content differently across sessions\n",
    "- **Cross-evaluator consistency**: Different evaluators may interpret and map identical content to different framework outputs\n",
    "- **Scale vs. thoroughness**: Growing volume of evaluation reports creates pressure to choose between speed and comprehensive analysis"

    "## What is Evaluatr?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Evaluatr` is an AI-powered system that automates mapping evaluation reports against structured frameworks while maintaining interpretability and human oversight. Initially developed for [IOM (International Organization for Migration)](https://www.iom.int) evaluation reports and the [Strategic Results Framework (SRF)](https://srf.iom.int), it transforms a traditionally manual, time-intensive process into an efficient, transparent workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system maps evaluation reports against hierarchical frameworks like the SRF (objectives, enablers, cross-cutting priorities, outcomes, outputs, indicators) and connects to broader frameworks like the [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org) for interoperability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond automation, `Evaluatr` prioritizes **interpretability and human-AI collaboration**‚Äîenabling evaluators to understand the mapping process, audit AI decisions, perform error analysis, and build training datasets over time, ensuring the system aligns with organizational needs through actionable, transparent, auditable methodology."

    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Document Preparation Pipeline ‚úÖ **Available**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Repository Processing**: Read and preprocess IOM evaluation report repositories with standardized outputs\n",
    "- **Automated Downloads**: Batch download of evaluation documents from diverse sources\n",
    "- **OCR Processing**: Convert scanned PDFs to searchable text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology\n",
    "- **Content Enrichment**: Fix OCR-corrupted headings and enrich documents with AI-generated image descriptions for high-quality input data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. AI-Assisted Framework Mapping ‚úÖ **Available**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Stage Pipeline**: Three-stage mapping process that progressively narrows from broad themes ( SRF Enablers, Cross-cutting Priorities, GCM objectives) to specific SRF outputs. Each stage enriches context for the next‚Äîfor example, knowing a report is cross-cutting in nature helps accurately map specific SRF outputs\n",
    "- **Cost Optimization**: Leverages LLM prompt caching to minimize token usage and API costs during repeated analysis\n",
    "- **Command-line Interface**: Streamlined pipeline execution through easy-to-use CLI tools (`evl_ocr`, `evl_md_plus`, `evl_tag`)\n",
    "- **Transparent Tracing**: Complete audit trails of AI decisions stored for human review and evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Knowledge Synthesis üìã **Planned**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Knowledge Cards**: Generate structured summaries for downstream AI tasks like proposal writing and synthesis\n"
