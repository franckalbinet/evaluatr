Introduction (page 10)** - Sets out the objectives and purpose of the evaluation\n3. **6. Results (page 24)** - This is the main findings section, covering multiple outcome areas (conflict, services, school enrollment, women's participation, etc.). This section spans approximately 13 pages (24-37) and is the heart of the evaluation\n4. **7. Discussion (page 36)** - Where authors interpret and contextualize the findings\n5. **8. Conclusion (page 37)** - Final synthesis of what matters most\n\nI'm excluding sections 2-5 as they cover background context, research design, methodology, and data collection - important for understanding the study but not where authors signal core themes.

References to staff are contextual (e.g., staff turnover undermining capacity building, IOM staff conducting surveys, MRC operators providing services) rather than examining IOM\'s workforce planning, people management systems, or workplace experience as evaluation objectives.\n\nThe report\'s main focus areas are: program relevance and effectiveness for migrants/returnees, community-based reintegration, migration data systems, stakeholder capacity building, and sustainability of results. Staff-related observations appear as implementation factors or constraints, not as subjects of systematic evaluation against workforce development criteria.\n\nA synthesis specifically on IOM workforce management would not identify this as a key source.',

The JI-HoA is explicitly structured around partnership: it's a Joint Initiative between EU and IOM; multiple sections emphasize partnerships with national/local governments, civil society, service providers, and implementing partners (67 reintegration partners mentioned). The integrated approach requires multi-stakeholder collaboration across individual, community, and structural levels. Major findings address partnership effectiveness: capacity building with governments, referral systems between organizations, and coordination mechanisms. Key recommendations (especially #1) focus on enhancing stakeholder engagement and ownership. The sustainability analysis heavily examines whether partnerships can continue post-program. The coherence section evaluates alignment with IOM's partnership principles and UN Network on Migration. Partnership isn't just mentioned—it's the operational model through which all objectives are pursued.",

Budget and funding discussions appear as contextual information to assess efficiency (Section 7) and whether resources were sufficient to achieve objectives, but these are means to evaluate program performance, not the central focus.\n\nFor a synthesis on funding/financing in migration programs, this report would provide limited insights - mainly some examples of budget allocation across objectives and discussion of resource sufficiency, but would not be a primary source on funding mechanisms, innovative financing, or resource mobilization strategies.',

Environmental sustainability does not appear in the programme\'s main objectives, is not addressed in any dedicated section of findings, does not feature in the evaluation criteria scores or major conclusions, and is absent from all recommendations.

The evaluation extensively examines: (1) Partnership mechanisms - evaluating 67 reintegration partners including 29 government and 38 non-state actors, with dedicated assessment of partnership quality and sustainability; (2) Capacity building - a major program pillar with dedicated budget (13.5% of EUR 64.7M) for building government and stakeholder capacity in migration governance; (3) International cooperation frameworks - the program itself is a Joint Initiative implementing coordinated regional migration governance; (4) Technical assistance - extensive support to national governments for developing migration policies, SOPs, and referral systems. Multiple recommendations explicitly call for "enhanced international cooperation" and strengthening partnerships.

While the report extensively covers crisis-affected populations (migrants, refugees, displaced persons), it does not address water and sanitation services as a programmatic focus.\n\nThe report\'s three main components are: (1) strengthening migration governance frameworks, (2) improving integrated border management and combating trafficking/smuggling, and (3) protecting victims of trafficking and vulnerable migrants. These focus on policy development, institutional capacity building, border management systems (MIDAS, IBMCs), legal frameworks, training law enforcement, victim protection services, and awareness campaigns.\n\nWASH is never mentioned in the executive summary, findings, recommendations, or evaluation criteria sections. The "direct assistance" mentioned refers to shelter, food, medical aid, MHPSS, and legal support - not WASH infrastructure or services. While migrants may receive basic needs support at transit centers, this is incidental rather than a programmatic focus on comprehensive WASH service delivery.\n\nFor a WASH-focused synthesis, this report would provide minimal value as it doesn\'t examine water/sanitation service quality, coverage, or access as primary outcomes.',

The evaluation centrally focuses on strengthening protection services and referral mechanisms for vulnerable migrants and victims of trafficking across the East and Horn of Africa region. \n\nSpecific Objective 3 is dedicated entirely to improving "Protection services for Victims of Trafficking and vulnerable migrants at local, national, and regional levels." The report extensively documents IOM\'s work on developing National Referral Mechanisms (NRMs), training frontline protection actors, establishing coordination platforms for referrals, and improving access to protection facilities. Key achievements include: training 561 stakeholders on victim identification and referral (exceeding targets), supporting NRM development in multiple countries, establishing coordination mechanisms in Uganda and Kenya, and providing direct assistance to over 12,000 migrants through referral pathways.\n\nMultiple sections detail referral pathway strengthening: development of NRM training packages, validation of victim hotline handbooks, establishment of inter-agency coordination bodies, and creation of referral protocols. The sustainability section explicitly addresses concerns about maintaining these referral systems beyond donor funding. This is not tangential work - protection referral pathways are fundamental to the programme\'s third pillar and feature prominently in findings, recommendations, and impact discussions.',

Excluding this report from a synthesis on IOM\'s global data initiatives would create significant gaps in understanding regional data strengthening efforts in a major migration corridor.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a TOP source for synthesizing IOM\'s work on migration data systems, evidence generation, and data-driven policy development.',

The evaluation explicitly focuses on three interconnected components that directly align with SRF 1b33: (1) strengthening migration governance with human rights-based approaches, (2) supporting institutions to combat trafficking and smuggling, and (3) protecting victims of trafficking and vulnerable migrants. The report demonstrates centrality through: multiple major sections dedicated to migrant protection (entire Specific Objective 3 focuses on protection services for VoTs and vulnerable migrants); key findings emphasizing protection mechanisms, referral systems, and direct assistance to over 12,000 migrants; substantial analysis of protection facilities, services, and coordination mechanisms; major recommendations addressing sustainability of protection services and national ownership of protection frameworks. The protection of vulnerable migrants is not merely a theme mentioned in this report—it is one of the three core pillars of the entire BMM programme being evaluated.

However, none of these activities are framed around reparations or restitution for human rights violations.
